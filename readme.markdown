DebugLog - nicer Javascript console logging
===========================================

All A-Grade Browsers come with some kind of console to which we can log from Javascript or can be extended.
Not all of them have a very nice output and logging without checking first can end up with errors.
DebugLog is written to make loggin to all kind of different consoles easier, prettier, more powerful etc...

* For Internet Explorer we can install the simple but free Companion.JS plugin:

* For Firefox we use the brilliant Firebug which you should have installed already or you've never written Javascript...
* Safari: 
* * enable: 'Preferences'->'Advanced'->'Show Develop menu in menu bar'
* * use: 'menu'->'develop'->'show error console'
* Chrome Developer build: view->developer->Javascript Console
* Opera: Tools->Advanced->'Error Console'
